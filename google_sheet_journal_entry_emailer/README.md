## Google Sheet Journal Entry Emailer

American novelist Louisa May Alcott once said, _'Preserve your memories, keep them well, what you forget you can never retell.'_

I really like this quote, and it captures why I've kept a journal since 2022, where I wrote down memories I'd like to recall in the future. I happen to use Google Sheets as my journal. I use the simplest of all formats: one column to store the date, and another column to store whatever I jot down for that day. Here's the format:

  </a>
</p>

I've accumulated a bunch of entries over the years, and I like to be reminded of those past memories as time goes on. That's why I wrote this Google App Script. The script simply scans the Google Sheet for past entries with the same month & day as the date it's running, and sends an email with the matches. I have it set to run every morning. Here's the email I got this morning which was generated by this script:

  </a>
</p>

Getting this email is a nice way to start my day and incetivizes me to journal more üôÇ

## Intructions

Here are instructions if you want to set this up for yourself:
1. Create Google Sheet with necessary columns by writing 'date' and 'memory' and cells A1 and B1, respectively. Replace tab name from 'Sheet1' to 'memories'
2. Create a Google Apps Script by click on 'Extensions' in the menu bar and then selecting 'Apps Script'
3. Replace the default code with the contents of [script.gs](https://github.com/nfeifel/animation/blob/main/google_sheet_journal_entry_emailer/script.gs)
4. Save and name the script (I named mine 'Memory Reminder')
5. Set up and manage triggers for the script by clicking on 'Triggers' in the left panel
6. Click the Run (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) button to test the script at any point (remember: it will only send you an email if there's an entry from the same month+day in a previous year in the sheet)
7. You'll have to authorize the script to be able to access Google Sheets and your emaail
8. Enjoy waking up to emails reminding you have memories from the past!


Needless to say, there's plenty of room from personalization here - from trigger cadences to the formatting of the content in the email - so don't hesitate to modify it to your liking.
