## Google Sheet Journal Entry Emailer

American novelist Louisa May Alcott once said, _'Preserve your memories, keep them well, what you forget you can never retell.'_

I really like this quote, and it captures why I've kept a journal since 2022, where I wrote down memories I'd like to recall in the future. I happen to use Google Sheets as my journal. I use the simplest of all formats: one column to store the date, and another column to store whatever I jot down for that day. Here's the format:

  </a>

I've accumulated a bunch of entries over the years, and I like to be reminded of those past memories as time goes on. That's why I wrote this Google App Script. The script simply scans the Google Sheet for past entries with the same month & day as the date it's running, and sends an email with the matches. I have it set to run every morning. Here's the email I got this morning which was generated by this script:

  </a>

Getting this email is a nice way to start my day and incetivizes me to journal more ðŸ™‚
