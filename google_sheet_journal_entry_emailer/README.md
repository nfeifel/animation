## Google Sheet Journal Entry Emailer

American novelist, Louisa May Alcott, once said “Preserve your memories, keep them well, what you forget you can never retell.”

I really like this quote, and it captures well why I've kept a journal since 2022. I happen to use Google Sheets as my journal where I wrote down memories I'd like to recall in the future. I use the simplest of all formats: one column to store the date, and another column to store whatever I jot down for that day. Here's the format:

I've accumulated a bunch of entries of the years, and I'd like to be reminded of those past memories as time goes on. That's why I wrote this Google App Script. The script simply scans the Google Sheet for past entries with the same month & day as the date it's running, and sends an email with the matches. Here's the email I got this morning which was generated by this script:
